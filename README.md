# Potato Disease Detection Model
This project features an AI-powered model designed to identify potato diseases at an early stage. Leveraging Keras for deep learning, FastAPI for building the API, and React for the frontend interface, this solution aims to help farmers detect and manage potato diseases promptly, reducing potential crop damage and losses.

## Key Features
Early Detection: Identify potato diseases in their early stages to prevent widespread damage.
Deep Learning: Utilizes a Keras-based neural network model for accurate disease classification.
FastAPI Backend: Provides a robust and scalable API for model inference.
React Frontend: User-friendly interface for farmers to upload images and receive instant feedback on plant health.
## Technologies Used
Keras: For building and training the machine learning model.
FastAPI: For creating the backend API.
React: For developing the frontend application.
